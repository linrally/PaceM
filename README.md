PaceM generates music based on users’ Spotify tastes that match their running pace and BPM. PaceM plays the songs directly in-app and curates a playlist that is just long enough for the user’s run. With PaceM, users can pace themselves even when they are not on the treadmill. And everyone can run to music that is curated for their personal stride length and desired running pace, which is calculated through our in-app algorithm. And the best part? Everyone is able to do it through music they love, all the while saving the environment!
